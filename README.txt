This programming assignment contains 4 python3.6 scripts to accomplish the color segmentation and barrel detection tasks.
The pixel.py is used to crop pixels to make blue barrel and not blue data sets using Roipoly.
The train.py is used to train a color classifier using logistic regressions method.
The Barrel_Detector.py is used to segment blue barrels from validation set images and draw bounding boxes around them.
The adjust,py is used to load individual image file and test the performance of  Barrel_Detector functions.
